# Expressions-SwiftUI

# XCode 11.0 beta 5 is required
## v0.1

Yeah! I'm trying to re-implement my old homemade project Expressions (https://apps.apple.com/ru/app/expressions-calculator/id423294430?l=en) using all new features of SwiftUI framework.
Also it would be a great playground of all new features of Swift and iOS. So no mo words, let's rock!

## The plan:
- Implement simple calc using SwiftUI
- Basic expressions logic like braces
- Bring expressions text field from original calc
- Add functions
- Add currency exchanger
- Add history
- Implement MacOS Expressions.
- Implement WatchOS Expressions.
- Bomus level: Implement TV OS Expressions (Am I Crazy:)?) With Voice recognition.
- Implement history sync
- Add syncronizable variables
- AppStore publishing

## Architecture & Support
No unit/ui/ux/integration/behavior/monkey tests. Only hardcode! Swift UI looks promissing so I would try to use MVVM + some singletones to cover all functionality.
Also I will try to keep all commits history in the good and production way.
